    // the lidar/ultrasonic sensors are mounted to a pan/tilt mechanism
    // while they share a common axes, they are offset from the axes so the beam would
    // translate/not just be angled
    // fortunately it is only the tilt axes that changes
    // box only dimensions
    // total side box height: 3.88"
    // lidar center from top: 1.44"
    // us sensor center from base: 1.5"
    // side view: axis is 2" from the floor (sensor box by itself
    // not sure how much this matters at this time
