- ### updates
  - [ ] dpad
    - [ ] add bars/slider
    - [ ] add quick center
    - [ ] add setup of major/minor ticks eg. increment by 1 vs. 5
  - [ ] move servo code
    - [ ] add callback when seharvo is done moving, or add matching delay before buttons enabled/able to move again
      - callback from Arduino i2c probably better in case comm delay

- ### reminders
  - socket service user specified is pi to have access to smbus2

### 11/01/2020
- [x] try out node i2c
  - see if it works
    - stop systemd code
    - try node i2c examples, check serial monitor
      - had to add new lines to stuff
      - doesn't work... write runs, Arduino receives nothing, error callback happens but says null
      - did have problems with the gcc install stuff(paths/package don't exist)
  - try to use it with websocket so Arduino response goes back up to web interface
- [ ] other alternatives
  - get websocket to work in Python, issue is Python version mixing

### 10/29/2020
- ### web interface
  - [ ] get feedback from Arduino after servos move
    - just echoes back command, front end uses to decide if next commands can go
    - just occurred to me, I need to be continuously listening to the Pi i2c to get anything back from the Arduino
    - which more than likely means some kind of thread and regarding communication between websocket/web interface...
      - probably have to write the socket in python instead vs. node, then the i2c listener thread can be started and ping the websocket that's running in python
      - no need to figure out how to communicate between python/node in real  time
      - so... when reading i2c the servos twitch... looks like it's a known problem, had a thought. I can just read out variables stored in Arduino by calling it(down send i2c)
    
  - [ ] trigger camera and display photo
  - [ ] get measurements from us and lidar by button click

### 10/27/2020
- ### web interface
  - [x] basic layout
  - [x] add basic servo control input
      - arrows and display of value
  - [x] add pi online status
      - [x] make this not hardcoded, possibly scannable by front end
  - [x] add websocket connected status
- ### pi
  - [x] setup basic node websocket
  - [x] send controls to arduino by system calls to python scripts
- ### arduino
  - [x] make basic servo state manager
  - [x] add accept capability to command servo from i2c and set state
