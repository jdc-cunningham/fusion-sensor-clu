### About
This is the vision process of this "aparatus". There is a single camera and I'm using 1D and 2D histograms to define the places to look to bind potential objects with HSV. Then using contour finding I find the largest area after a specific minimum area.

It is easier to visually see what I mean by the 1D/2D histograms seeing the images below.
